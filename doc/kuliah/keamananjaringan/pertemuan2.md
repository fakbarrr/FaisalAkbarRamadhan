Background
After we analyzed the security of the network we understand the important role that the security of a network, we urgently need their security system network in effect system network security is a weakness that allows that one can enter into the system the computer network in question but in accordance with the target to be headed.
System where there are weaknesses that can explore the attacker painful that the system does not run properly.
• dns Spooping ie false dns ip address that directs to a fake
• Mac is the system used for communication in local network / lan.
Explanation of Problems And Solutions
According to my response Vulnerability is a weakness in an unsuspecting network and unsupervised by admin happens a person can access to the computer with the target.
Types of Vulnebarility ie
1. Phsycal namely the storage of a physical building or else his
2. Natural namely Vulnerability in because by nature such as floods, earthquakes, tsunamis and other
3. Hardwear and softwear is a softwear that gave rise Hardwear and security holes in the system
4. Media is data backup, cdroom which can be damaged by dust or missing and electrical currents or can be stolen by parties who are not responsible.
5. Communications is a network of mutually bersangkutpautan with greater risk of computer hacking by others
6. Human ie the user can also jeopardize the existing system.
Conclusions and recommendations
The conclusion that I can from the above explanation, namely that Vulnebarility a weakness there and available in the network security of computer besides kelmahan it can collapse or be hacked by parties who are not responsible jaawab and hackers can access the computer that is targeted to suit his liking.
The advice I would say that the security network of the era to the more sophisticated and my suggestion that the use of security can not be breached by the lai that secrets or documents in your computer remains safe and is in a safe place
